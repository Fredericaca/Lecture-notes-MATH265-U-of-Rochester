# MATH265:RealAnalysis_Class_Notes_UofR
MATH265 RealAnalysis class notes in pdf+latex. Project inspired by [*Dexter Chua*](https://dec41.user.srcf.net/notes/). For me it is a great rapid note-taking practice on laptop. All tex and pdf files are open-source and free to view, copy and edit for study purpose. Great to see if you also suffer from Math. We got average 60% this semester 😭😭😭. 

All notes are taken by **Kaifeng Lu** on **MATH265 FALL 2024** by **Professor Wei-chung Huang**

Also available on Overleaf:

Note: You need to change the file path of **header.tex** in Math265_ClassNotes_Fall2024.tex before compile(this project assmumes that audiences will have basic latex editing experience for background). Here is how:

Change the following line of code in the Math265_ClassNotes_Fall2024.tex. 
```
\input{your/path/of/header.tex}
```

Pro advice: find *any available practice exam*(if you KNOW what I mean😎) and do practice question in the textbook *as much as you can*. Then you will get 80% for the most of the time.
