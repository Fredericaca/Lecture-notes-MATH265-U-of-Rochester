# MATH265:RealAnalysis_Class_Notes_UofR
## What is this project?
MATH265 RealAnalysis class notes in pdf+latex. Project inspired by [*Dexter Chua*](https://dec41.user.srcf.net/notes/). For me it is a great rapid note-taking practice on laptop. All tex and pdf files are open-source and free to view, copy and edit for study purpose. Great to see if you also suffer from Math. We got average 60% this semester ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. 

## Credit
All notes are taken by **Kaifeng Lu** on **MATH265 FALL 2024** by **Professor Wei-chung Huang**

## Latex on Overleaf
Also available on Overleaf:

Note: You need to change the file path of **header.tex** in Math265_ClassNotes_Fall2024.tex before compile(this project assmumes that audiences will have basic latex editing experience for background). Here is how:

Change the following line of code in the Math265_ClassNotes_Fall2024.tex. 
```
\input{your/path/of/header.tex}
```

## Pro advice: 
- [x] Find ***any*** *available practice exam*(if you KNOW what I meanðŸ˜Ž) and do them. 
- [x] Do practice question in the textbook ***as much as you can***.
- [x] Then you will get **80%** for the most of the exams. 
- [x] Don't worry cuz you will almost always get a **83%**, which is a solid ***A***.
- [x] [StackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/ "Best alternative for Chat ;)") will be your second best friend.(First best friend? No, ***JUST*** office hours and TA's.)
