# MATH265:RealAnalysis_Class_Notes_UofR
MATH265 class notes in pdf+latex. Project inspired by [*Dexter Chua*](https://dec41.user.srcf.net/notes/). For me it is a great practice for rapid note-taking on laptop. All tex and pdf files are open-source and free to view, copy and edit for study purpose.

All notes are taken by *Kaifeng Lu* on *MATH265 FALL 2024* by *Professor Wei-chung Huang*
