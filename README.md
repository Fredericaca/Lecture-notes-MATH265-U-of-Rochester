# Lecture notes of MATH265 Real Analysis at University of Rochester 
## What is this project?
MATH265 Real Analysis class notes in pdf+latex. Project inspired by [*Dexter Chua*](https://dec41.user.srcf.net/notes/). For me it is a great rapid note-taking practice on laptop. All tex and pdf files are open-source and free to view, copy and edit for study purpose. Great to see if you also suffer from Math. We got average 60% this semester ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. 

## Credit
All notes are taken by **Kaifeng Lu** on **MATH265 FALL 2024** by **Professor Wei-chung Huang** at **University of Rochester**

## Latex on Overleaf
Also available on Overleaf:

Note: You need to change the file path of **header.tex** in Math265_ClassNotes_Fall2024.tex before compile(this project assmumes that audiences will have basic latex editing experience for background). Here is how:

Change the following line of code in the Math265_ClassNotes_Fall2024.tex. 
```
\input{your/path/of/header.tex}
```

## Textbook, schedule, grading rubrics
- [Introduction to Real Analysis, 4th Edition, by Robert G. Bartle, Donald R. Sherbert](/Introduction%20to%20Real%20Analysis.pdf)
- [Schedule](/Schedule.png). Yes, we **skipped differentiation** in *Real Analysis* course. Ridiculous.

## Pro advice: 
- [x] Do NOT escape ***Office hours*** where you could solve most of your inhumane **homework**.
- [x] ***READ extensively***. **Textbook is much more helpful** than lecture. Follow the syllabus.
- [x] ***Do PROBLEMS*** on books. Do them ***as much as you can***. 
- [x] For this semester, **83%+** overall grade will ensure a solid ***A***. However, cutoffs will change a little for each semester.
- [x] Find ***any*** *available practice exam* (if you KNOW how to get themðŸ˜Ž). 
- [x] [StackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/ "Best alternative for Chat ;)") will be your second best friend.(First best friend? Not some \*BOT\*, ***JUST*** office hours and TA's.)
